<h1>Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" alt="wave" width="30" /></h1> 
<h3>I am John Paul Naiju</h3>
<h4>Self-taught engineer</h4>

Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, Colossians 3:23.

My journey as a self-taught engineer and researcher is fueled by an innate desire to unravel the mysteries of the universe and understand how everything works. My interests are incredibly broad, spanning the intricacies of `AI` and `Quantum Mechanics`, the foundational principles of `Physics` and `Mathematics`, and practical applications in `CAD`, `Electronics`, and `Robotics` etc even extending to `Biblical studies`. I'm a lifelong learner who thrives on exploring, comprehending, and building. I believe in harnessing this knowledge to create impactful technology, change lives, and contribute to society, all for the glory of Lord Jesus. Here, I'll be documenting my projects, past and present, as I continue to learn, build, and implement across the many fields that captivate me.

I do these to feed my curiosity and fullfill my purpose and not for make a living or job purpose. I love peace and want to become a sheep farmer in Switzerland and do part time preaching or smth useful 😅. Above all what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?
